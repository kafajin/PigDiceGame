# Pig Dice Game

Welcome to the Pig Dice Game! This game is a simple and entertaining dice game where players compete to be the first to reach a target score. It's a great way to have fun and test your luck!

## Game Overview

In the Pig Dice Game, players take turns rolling a dice. Each player's turn consists of repeatedly rolling the dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold", "quit" or "cheat". Here are the basic rules:

- If a player rolls a 1, they score nothing for that turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If a player rolls any other number (2-6), that number is added to their turn total, and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold," their turn total is added to their overall score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If a player chooses to "quit", the game turminates.
- If a player chooses to "cheat", the player wins directly.
- The first player to reach a target score (e.g., 100 points) or higher wins the game.
